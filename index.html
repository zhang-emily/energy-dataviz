        <h2>Energy Generation by State</h2>
        <p>In the U.S., energy generation is highly geographical and often depends on what resources are readily avaiable
          in a given region. The map below shows the dominant energy source for generation for each state in 2019. <br><br>
          For example, natural gas is the dominant source of electricity generation in the South and mid-Atlantic. 
          Coal is dominant much of the central U.S. For carbon-free electricity sources, it is encouraging to see wind 
          dominate in Midwestern states such as Iowa and Kansas, in large part due to how windy these states are. 
          Hydroelectric is the primary energy source in several states in the Pacific Northwest and New England. 
          Nuclear provides the biggest proportion of energy several states in the Eastern U.S.
